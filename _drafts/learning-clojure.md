## Why learning clojure?
TODO journey picture
### Where I come from
* Turbo Pascal in School
* Basic
* Background, experience with programming languages so far - Where I come from?
  * Lots of Java
  * C and C++
  * Experience with Spring Boot <-> implementing Web services
  * Toyed around with Javascript
  * "Backend Programmer"
    * Interested in Software Architecture and Databases
* Why learn a new programming language?
  * Heard about functional programming in university (Standard ML)
  * Took some trainings (props to Mike Sperber)
  * my interest was growing
  * looking for a "real" functional programming language to learn it
  * how does it feel to program in a functional paradigm language?
* Why Clojure?
  * Why Clojure (and not e.g. Haskell)
    * can be compiled to JVM Bytecode (can benefit from existing JVM)
    * existing Java libraries can be used
* interesting facts about clojure
  * REPL
  * totally different than the programming languages I have worked with
    * REPL, inspector, atoms ...
  * it is a LISP
    * "Structure and interpretation of computer programs" (SICP is a book I wanted to read since university
    * teaches you to think differently about programming
    * has an benefit even when not used in practice
    * TODO link to article what from HackerNews (why lisp is a superior language)
    

## How I learn
* In general: I learn best when I get both Theory and Practice
* [TODO Clojure for the brave an true book]()
* doing the examples on the REPL
* playing around with the language on the REPL
* doing smaller projects using the language (cronly, git-sprit)
  * why? teaches you things like working with dependencies, debugging, deployment, packaging ..
* learn about the theory: watch talks from rich hickey
* try to find a local group and try to explain concepts
* plan: write small blog posts explaining what you have learned
* try to answer stack overflow question?
* doing code "katas": advent-of-code, random algorithmic puzzles like 8 queens problem or staircase-problem + exercism
* IDE
  * started out with cursive
  * switched to Spacemacs 
  * important: being able to learn via REPL and have the IDE support your workflow
