## Why learning clojure?
* Background, experience with programming languages so far
  * Lot of Java
  * C
  * Experience with Spring Boot <-> implementing Web services
  * "Backend Programmer"
* interesting facts about clojure
  * REPL
  * totally different than the programming languages I have worked with
  * it is a LISP
    * "Structure and interpretation of computer programs" (SICP is a book I wanted to read since university
    * teaches you to think differently about programming
  * can be compiled to JVM Bytecode (can benefit from existing JVM)
  * Java libraries can be used

## how I learn
* [TODO Clojure for the brave an true book]()
* doing the examples on the REPL
* playing around with the language on the REPL
* doing smaller projects using the language (cronly, git-sprit)
  * why? teaches you things like working with dependencies, debugging, deployment, packaging ..
* learn about the theory: watch talks from rich hickey
* try to find a local group and try to explain concepts
* plan: write small blog posts explaining what you have learned
* try to answer stack overflow question?
* doing code "katas": advent-of-code, random algorithmic puzzles like 8 queens problem or staircase-problem
* IDE
  * started out with cursive
  * switched to Spacemacs 
  * important: being able to learn via REPL and have the IDE support your workflow
