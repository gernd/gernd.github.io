This year was the first time that I visited the [Socrates Conference](https://www.socrates-conference.de/home) in Soltau.
There were many things that made me looking forward to it. At first, it has been a long time since I had visited a conference in real life, so I was excited to see that many 
people in person again. I was also curious, how many people from different countries would participate. My hope was to get exposed to topics, that are completely new for me
and also learn about different approaches and opinions about aspects of software engineering that I am already familiar with. I always enjoy talking to people that are passionate about
software crafting. A collegague of mine TODO link Ajit has been an organizer for several years TODO ticket from jambit.

As I enjoyed it a lot, I decided to share my experiences that I made during the event.

## What information did I have before I attended the socrates conference (from their website)? 
Socrates is a non-profit and community run (un)conference about all things related to software craft. The focus is on creating an inclusive environment where everyone is able to 
learn together, connect and participate. There is a lot of help for people who are new to the conference or software crafting in general.  At first there is a 
[Foundation Day](https://www.socrates-conference.de/foundations) with sessions covering foundational topics like TDD or Refactoring intended to open up the world of crafting and 
testing for newcomers. The conference also supports the concept of a [Conference Buddy](https://www.conferencebuddy.io) offering support for persons who are at a conference for the
first time. The main part of the conference is a 2-day [Open Space](http://agilecoachcamp.org/tiki-index.php?page=OpenSpace) where people present sessions they would like to talk about,
which means that there is no fixed agenda before the event as this evolves depending on the participants interests.

## How was the actual experience?
I already got to know some people during the World Cafe that took place on Thursday evening. Some told me, that they had been attending the conference for many 
years and always wanted to go back because of the unique experience. A running group was announced that started in the morning, which I attended throughout the 
whole conference. In the following 2 days, the Open Space took place. I was really amazed how many people were eager 
to present a session, so that the schedule would never run out. The topics of the sessions were quite diverse, including TDD, clojure, hiring, code katas,
agile working and many others. And also sheep :-) Also the format of each session was quite open, ranging from presentations, discussions or other formats
like 4-2-2-all. You also did not have to be an expert for a topic to propose a session. It was also ok to ask other people to teach you.
To give you an idea, I attended the following sessions throughout the conference:

* Note-taking and knowledge management
* Test Commit Revert
* How bad are mono repos actually?
* How can we cultivate a learning culture
* Experiences with trunk-based-development
* Non-binary people in binary organizations
* Clojure Workshop
* Building your own keyboard AMA
* Unit test Anti-patterns

On top of all the sessions for knowledge sharing, there were a lot of things going on in the evening as well. You could choose from playing boardgames, 
powerpoint karaoke and much more in the evening or going for a run or doing morning medidation. All this was offered by the participants.

## Things I took from the conference
* very inclusive
* organizers managed to create a super inclusive atmosphere 
-> everyone was participating and could be, who they are
* great atmosphere
* super friendly people
* people were really motivated to participate
* learned a lot
* got to know some cool people
* flexible schedule, was created during the event
## Would I go there again?
* definitely yes

Special thanks to my employer [jambit](https://www.jambit.com) who acts as a sponsor for this event and made it possible for me to attend this great event and also my collegague Ajit TODO link twitter as an organizer who introduced me to the conference in the first place.
