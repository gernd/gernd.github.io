This year was the first time that I visited the [Socrates Conference](https://www.socrates-conference.de/home) in Soltau.
There were many things that made me looking forward to it. At first, it has been a long time since I had visited a conference in real life, so I was excited to see that many 
people in person again. I was also curious, how many people from different countries would participate. My hope was to get exposed to topics, that are completely new for me
and also learn about different approaches and opinions about aspects of software engineering that I am already familiar with. I always enjoy talking to people that are passionate about
software crafting. A collegague of mine TODO link Ajit has been an organizer for several years TODO ticket from jambit.

As I enjoyed it a lot, I decided to share my experiences that I made during the event.

## What information did I have before I attended the socrates conference (from their website)? 
Socrates is a non-profit and community run (un)conference about all things related to software craft. The focus is on creating an inclusive environment where everyone is able to 
learn together, connect and participate. There is a lot of help for people who are new to the conference or software crafting in general.  At first there is a 
[Foundation Day](https://www.socrates-conference.de/foundations) with sessions covering foundational topics like TDD or Refactoring intended to open up the world of crafting and 
testing for newcomers. The conference also supports the concept of a [Conference Buddy](https://www.conferencebuddy.io) offering support for persons who are at a conference for the
first time. The main part of the conference is a 2-day [Open Space](http://agilecoachcamp.org/tiki-index.php?page=OpenSpace) where people present sessions they would like to talk about,
which means that there is no fixed agenda before the event as this evolves depending on the participants interests.

## How was the actual experience?
* first evening (World cafe): get to know each other
* in total: about 200 participants
* already got the impression, that people are very inclusive and got to know that they attended the conference for many years
* following 2 days: marketplace, where people introduced their sessions
* could also be something like : teach me about ..."
** everyone just shortly introduces their topic and finds a free slot in the agenda
** topics: agile working, hiring, code katas, TDD, clojure, ...
TODO: describe some sessions that I attended
* on top: evening and morning sessions (going for a run, playing boardgames, powerpoint karaoke ..)
* very inclusive
* "come as you are"

## Things I took from the conference
* great atmosphere
* super friendly people
* people were really motivated to participate
* learned a lot
* got to know some cool people
* flexible schedule, was created during the event
## Would I go there again?
* definitely yes

Special thanks to my employer [jambit](https://www.jambit.com) who acts as a sponsor for this event and made it possible for me to attend this great event and also my collegague Ajit TODO link twitter as an organizer who introduced me to the conference in the first place.
