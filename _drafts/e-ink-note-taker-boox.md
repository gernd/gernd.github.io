# The Boox series
One of the first e-ink note takers that I took a closer look at during my [quest for finding an e-ink note taker](https://www.gernotpointner.de/2022/05/26/quest-for-finding-an-e-ink-note-taker.html)
where some products from the Onyx Boox series. Onyx offers a wide range of e-ink note taking devices and readers, starting its business in already 2006.

# Onyx Book Nova 3 Color
The first product from the Boox series that I took a look at was the [Nova 3 Color](https://onyxboox.com/boox_nova3color). It is an Android-powered tablet that comes with an included Stylus pen.
Compared to the other note-taking devices it clearly stands out because of its coloured display which is capable of displaying 4096 colors. While this does not really benefit my usecase, the reviews were quite positive about it. With a price of about 420-460â‚¬ it 
is definitely in a higher pricing segment.

According to the [PCMag Review](https://onyxboox.com/review/ebook-onyx-boox-nova3color-pcmag/) the Stylus Pen works very well for all apps that are included in the Onxy Suite. This also allows for editing PDFs, 
which is one part one of my most important usecases. The notes can also be exported to a variety of formats. As you can enable the Play Store and download Android apps, there are apps available to allow for syncing files via SFTP for uploading to my Cloud Storage (e.g. 
[FolderSync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.lite&hl=en&gl=US )) and mirroring the screen to my Mac (e.g. [X-Mirage](https://x-mirage.com/x-mirage/)). 

The [review on Android central](https://www.androidcentral.com/onyx-boox-nova3-color-review) rates the support for note taking as a great experience that feels like writing on paper. The pen supports 4096 levels of pressure and is said to being comparable to the 
Remarkable 2 pen. The Book Nova 3 Color is described as lighter than most tablets. Telling from the review, especially when using Android apps the note taker is laggy despite its 3GB of RAM.

One common criticism from the reviews is that for apps with frequent screen changes like youtube videos or games ghosting appears (which means that some fragments of the screen are not properly updated).
This also seemed to be the case sometimes when reading PDFs. 

## Summary

In summary, the Onxy Book Nova 3 Color seems to meet all requirements for my use cases although being quite pricey and its main selling point, the color display, being of very little importance to my needs. Ghosting also seems to be a minor problem, but should not affect
me that much. The great writing experience and the high-quality pen is definitely a plus.
