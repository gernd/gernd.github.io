# The Boox series

TODO Link to previous post (Quest for E-ink note taker)


One of the first e-ink note takers that I took a closer look at where some products from the boox series. There are plenty products available from onyx and it seems that they have some experience creating tables and e-ink note taking devices.


# Onyx Book Nova 3 Color
The first product from the Boox series that took a look at was the [Nova 3 Color](https://onyxboox.com/boox_nova3color). It is an Android-powered tablet that comes with an included Stylus pen.
Compared to the other note-taking devices it clearly stands out because of having a coloured display that is capable of displaying 4096 colors. While this does not really benefit my usecase, 
the reviews were quite positive about it. With a price of about 420 - 460 â‚¬ it is definitely in a higher pricing segment. According to 
[a review on PCMag](https://onyxboox.com/review/ebook-onyx-boox-nova3color-pcmag/) the Stylus Pen works very well for all apps that are included in the Onxy Suite. This also allows for editing PDFs, 
which is one part one of my most important usecases. Also the support for note taking was rated as a great experience that feels like writing on paper. The notes can also be exported to a variety of
formats. As you can enable the Play Store, there should be apps available to allow for Syncing files via SFTP for uploading to my Cloud Storage and transferring the screen to my Mac

One common criticism from the reviews is that for apps with frequent screen changes like youtube videos or games ghosting appears (which means that some fragments of the screen are not properly updated)
This also seemed to be the case sometimes when reading PDFs. This should not have that much of an effect to my usecases.

In summary, the Onxy Book Nova 3 Color seems to meet all requirements for my usecases although being quite pricey and its main selling point, the color display, being of very little importance to my needs.
