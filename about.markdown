Hey! You found my place on the internet! My name is Gernot Pointner, I work as a Team Lead and Software Developer in Leipzig, Germany.

I am interested in building effective software teams, software architecture and functional programming. In my free time I enjoy playing basketball, cycling and reading. I am a big fan of 90ies video games (especially SNES RPGs) and Hip Hop.
