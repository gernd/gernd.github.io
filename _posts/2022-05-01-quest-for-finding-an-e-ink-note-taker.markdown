# Why don't just use a digital tool for note-taking?

For my private software projects I often find myself switching between numerous digital tools for note-taking (e.g. github wikis, notion and markdown files).

Nevertheless I still find myself using plain old pen and paper for some usecases:

  * Making quick notes
  * Drawing mind-map like or architecture diagrams
  * Sketching ideas when discussing with other people
  * Annotating print-outs of documents with questions and summarizing paragraphs
  
For me this mixture of using digital tools and pen and paper lead to some problems:

  * Sometimes the same information is spread across digital tools and pieces of paper 
  * Information on pieces of paper is barely searchable
  * Manual digitization of notes (by taking photos or scanning them) creates additional effort which often results in not doing it
  * When annotating larger documents, I have to print the whole document at first and then rescan it again to retain my notes
  
For keeping tbe feeling of "writing on a piece of paper" and tackle the aforementioned problems of analogous note-taking, an e-ink note taking device seems to the obvious choice.

# Bridging the gap
My setup consists of my Macbook and a cloud based file share (HiDrive in my case). The cloud based service is accessible via SFTP and also via native Android/iOS apps and a web based interface. For my e-ink note taker I would like to have the following use cases supported

* taking notes and saving them as an image to the cloud service
* mirroring the screen of the note taking device to the Macbook to it can be used during online meetings or for presentations
* annotating pdf documents on the cloud file share

Of course a long battery run-time and a moderate price are also favourable. For the device I am not looking for any functionality besides note-taking (like a media player or web browsing).
Also OCR is not a high-priority feature for my usecase, as I consider my notes to be more sketching than texting.

I'll document my findings in the posts to follow. Stay tuned :-)
