# Why don't just use an editor?

In my daily work as a software engineer and team lead as well as for personal projects I often find myself switching between numerous digital tools for note-taking (confluence, notion, text-files ...).

Until now I still find myself using plain old pen and paper for certain usecases

* For some usecases scribbling just feels better for me
  * Making quick notes
  * Drawing mind-map like diagrams
  * Drawing architecture diagrams
  * Annotating documents with questions

* Problems
  * Inconsistencies and notes spread (some are on pieces of paper, some are as text in wikis..)
  * manually taken notes are hard to search
  * Manual digitization of notes (taking photos, scanning,,, ) -> additional effort
  * When annotating larger documents, you have to print the whole document
  
TODO move this to problems
Sometimes these notes just vanish or I have to invest additional work to somehow digitize them. 

That's why I thought about giving a e-ink note takers a try
  
# Bridging the gap
* My hopes for an ideal workflow
TODO
* My setup
  * Cloud based service (Hidrive, accessible via SFTP) for my personal notes
  * Confluence/Microsoft One Drive for work related notes
  * 2 Macbooks (one for work and my personal one)
  * and the note-taking device
TODO
* Things I focus on
  * sharing notes on the screen for showing things during meetings and being able to screenshot them

TODO
* Lower priority
  * colour display
  *
